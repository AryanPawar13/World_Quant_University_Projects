## Project: Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te d'Ivoire

We looked at a data science competition: [Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/) 
helping scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve. The goal is to take images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. 
To complete the competition, we expanded our machine learning skills by creating more powerful neural network models that can take images as inputs and classify them 
into one of multiple categories.

## Key concepts and skills gained :

1. How to read image files and prepare them for machine learning
2. How to use PyTorch to manipulate tensors and build a neural network model
3. How to build a Convolutional Neural Network that works well with images
4. How to use that model to make predictions on new images
5. How to turn those predictions into a submission to the competition
