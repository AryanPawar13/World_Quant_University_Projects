A repository containing all the projects that were carried out during my Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision learning at WorldQuant University.

## The Projects
1. Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te d'Ivoire:
In this project, you'll look at a data science competition: Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/) helping scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve. The goal is to take images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. To complete the competition, you'll expand your machine learning skills by creating more powerful neural network models that can take images as inputs and classify them into one of multiple categories.
