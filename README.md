A repository containing all the projects that were carried out during my Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision learning at WorldQuant University.

## The Projects
1. Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te d'Ivoire:
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify animals in camera trap images for a wildlife preserve. We learnt to process image data, use PyTorch for neural networks, build and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), make predictions, and submit results to a data science competition: [Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/)
